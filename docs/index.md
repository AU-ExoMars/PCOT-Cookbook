# The PCOT cookbook

This is a repository of useful PCOT documents containing graphs for performing
common tasks. Typically, the graphs are saved with some small images as
example data. To use your own data, click on the input button at the top of
the screen which corresponds to the input you want to replace (this is almost
always input 0) and load the required input. You may need to ensure that your
data has the bands the graph expects, or edit the graph accordingly.

You will probably have to edit the graph somewhat to produce the
analysis you need, but these will give you a starting point from
which to do that, as well as providing useful examples.
