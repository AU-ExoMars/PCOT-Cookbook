# Camera data

<!-- Note to authors: Do not edit the index.md directly, edit 
     header.txt and use ./gencams.py. See the README. -->

This directory contains camera definition files. These contain:

* what filters a camera has, and for each filter:
    * a name, position and description
    * centre wavelength, bandwidth etc.
* optional reflectance data for each filter for each patch in a target
* optional flat and dark fields (which make the file huge, but it can't
be helped)

Each file is a PCOT archive (`.parc`) file which should be placed
in the cameras directory. This must be specified in the `.pcot.ini` file
in the locations section:

```ini
[Locations]
cameras = /home/white/PCOT/cameras
```
If not specified, no cameras will be loaded! The `.pcot.ini` can be
found in the user's home directory.

!!! danger
    The flatfield and reflectance calibration data are probably 
    placeholders at best - they are certainly inaccurate!
