DO NOT edit the index.md file by hand. Instead,
edit header.txt and run 

    ./gencams.py > index.md

This will output the header followed by the actual camera file
data from PCOT.

Note that this means that the data in PCOT's camera directory
must match the data in this directory - gencams.py will use PCOT's
data, not the data here.
